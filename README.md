# Accessible address finder in 3 simple steps:
Will soon have a corresponding blog post!

### [Step one: Something that works](https://github.com/zoeabryant/accessible-address-finder/tree/something-that-works)

### [Step two: Semantic HTML](https://github.com/zoeabryant/accessible-address-finder/tree/semantic-html)

### [Step three: Annoucing changes](https://github.com/zoeabryant/accessible-address-finder/tree/annoucing-changes)

# Files:

* `clear.svg` a small svg x icon used on a button
* `index.css` a bunch of CSS
* `index.html` a HTML page with a div#root for react to hook onto, and our JS dependencies at the bottom
* `index.js` the React app

# Running this example

You can either just open `index.html` in your browser, or spin up a simple local HTTP server. If you are on a mac, ruby is provided so you can run `ruby -run -e httpd . -p 8000` to get a simple local HTTP server.
