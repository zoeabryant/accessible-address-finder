# Step two: Announce changes

A basic react.js app that has an 'address finder' feature that spits out dummy data. Now it annouces changes to screen readers when the content loads.

# Files:

* `clear.svg` a small svg x icon used on a button
* `index.css` a bunch of CSS
* `index.html` a HTML page with a div#root for react to hook onto, and our JS dependencies at the bottom
* `index.js` the React app

# Running this example

You can either just open `index.html` in your browser, or spin up a simple local HTTP server. If you are on a mac, ruby is provided so you can run `ruby -run -e httpd . -p 8000` to get a simple local HTTP server.
